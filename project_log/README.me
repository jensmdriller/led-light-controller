## Project Log (2018)

#### 1/12/2018 - JD:
- Since getting a biotech job, this project has laid dormant. However, in the last 12 months, I've vastly improved my programming abilities to the point where the software implementation should now be easier than the hardware. Still don't have app dev experience, but hope to learn that soon
- As anticipated, the smart home is now more popular than ever. Working in the IoT space should prove to be really interesting and eventful
- Today, I've moved a lot of the project files to the git repo. Hopefully this should serve as a catalyst to get the project up and running again

## Project Log (2017)

#### 1/12/2017 - JD:
- Compiled all files relevant to the project and uploaded them onto the Google Drive. I will try to keep the Google Drive as updated as possible. 
- Reviewed the necessary connections to integrate the WiFi module and CryptoAuthentication chip with the microcontroller (MCU). Determined that 9 or 10 connections are necessary, but will probably end up using more
- Minimum: Comms-SPI(4),Crypto-I2C(2),PWR, GND, RESET, IOREF(?)

#### 1/13/2017 - JD:
- Created a spreadsheet for hardware components used in the design. Will update as needed. 
Found and uploaded Arduino Uno R3 bill of materials (BOM)
- Looked into clock sources and design considerations. See HSDD for reference. 
- Hardware observations: Arduino likes to use matched resistor arrays whenever possible. However, no capacitor networks that I am aware of. Single components predominantly have 0603 footprint with some 0805. Arrays - 1206. Diodes - 1206 and DO-214AA
- LMV358 (1) buffers clock signal to turn on a LED and (2) compares VIN from USB and power jack (open loop comparator configuration)

#### 1/14/2017 - JD:
- Began programming LED sequences via the Arduino Uno. Note the MCU in the Uno is not powerful enough to support the WiFi module and the LED code. Thus, this is solely for testing purposes. However, it sure is a lot of fun!
- Turns out I messed up the red part of one of the LEDs. My guess is that the wire bond popped or excessive current destroyed the PN junction. Regardless, proper capacitor filtering on the power supply input is needed for the final design (as well as a 400 ohm resistor on the input). 
- Forgot to tie grounds together thus causing it not to work. Must remember to do so. 
- Created an LED sequence to start in the middle and propagate in either direction. 

#### 1/15/2017 - JD:
- Wrote code for Wiper, reverse colorwipe, color strobe, and a bit more. Still playing around, trying to learn a bit more about coding with these
- Discovered FastLED (see uploaded doc in Software). They improve on the NeoPixel code. Additionally, it directly supports a WiFi module. Let’s see what we can learn from analyzing their code
- Also, totally gave myself a headache today while programming these things. We should ship each set with some ibuprofen included. 
- Will need a level shifter if using a 3.3v MCU?

#### 1/16/2017 - JD:
- Created altium model for WINC1500 WiFi module

#### 1/17/2017 - JD:
- Began formulating a plan for powering the controller. Debating possible integration of AC-to-DC converter since these are so prevalent in the industry now. 

#### 1/18/2017 - JD:
- Been quite busy lately, but have been looking into AVR Studio 7 for programming the microcontroller (MCU). Will continue learning the code behind how these things work. 

#### 1/19/2017 - JD:
- Begun mapping out (on paper) the pins for the MCU and associated connections
- Will upload a pin assignment diagram to the project folder soon
- Discovered that the ICSP programming that the UNO utilizes is not supported by the SAMD21G18A MCU. To program, we would need to acquire an Atmel ICE (10 pin)
- Uploaded Atmel ICE user guide in software folder
- No Data In On JTAG header? Will we not use this for the LED controller?
- Note the ICE unit should use the SAM side and not the AVR side when programming
- LIFX Z is a commercial product that is similar to what we are looking to do. Except it is more expensive, less functionality etc. (and the power transfer seems fishy to me)
- However, someone adapted their arduino to use the company’s app and their hardware

- Sorry I’ve been MIA. I got a job in SF and am moving to berkeley. Crazzzzzyy times right? Anyhow, I’ll be busy for a bit but pick back up the project when things get settled
